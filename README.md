TIMON

=====

TIMON (This Is My Other Number) is an application that register calls, sms and mms sent to your phone and sends a report to you by email.
This application is perfect if you got an old phone with an active phone number. You don't want to carry the phone with you but you still want to know if someone trying to reach you using your old number...

It can also filter out and ignore calls from telemarketers using third-party databases like "missat samtal" and "vem ringde?".
