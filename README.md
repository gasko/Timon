TIMON

=====

TIMON (This Is My Other Number) is an application that register calls, sms and mms sent to a phone and sends att summary by email.
It can also filter out and ignore calls from telemarkes using thiird-party databases like "missat samtal" and "vem ringde?".

The use case and reason for why I built this app is that I got an old phonenumber and a old android phone. My old phonenumber is still active but I never carry the old phone with me. So if someone calls my old phone, it will instantly send me an email with an notify that someone tried to contact me.
And if I want I can give a call back...
